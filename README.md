A simple implementation of a unique cryptocurrency token on the Ethereum blockchain is the {MyToken} smart contract. It has features that enable the generation and destruction of tokens as needed, such as minting and burning.

### Important Elements: - **Token Specifics**: 

  - Call name: {HANAN}
  - Indicator: {HNN}
  
**Total Supply**: Maintains track of the overall quantity of tokens in use.

**Balances**: - A mapping that documents each token holder's balance.

### Features: 1. **Mint**: - Increases the overall supply by adding new tokens to a designated address.
   To mint 100 tokens to the address {0x123...{, use the following example: `mint(0x123..., 100)}.

2. **Burn**: - Lowers the overall supply by removing tokens from a designated address.
   - As an illustration, the command `burn(0x123..., 50)} burns 50 tokens from the address {0x123...}.

Remix IDE and other tools can be used to deploy and interact with this contract.
